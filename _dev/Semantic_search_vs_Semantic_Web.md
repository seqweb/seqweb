Semantic search and the Semantic Web are distinct concepts:

* Semantic search is a *search application* pattern that focuses on improving the search experience by understanding user query intent, rather than simply matching text "tokens".  It may consider context, relationships between words, user history, and other factors.  Semantic search characteristically exploits *natural* language-oriented technologies.


* The Semantic Web, in contrast, is a *data augmentation* pattern for the "classic" World Wide Web.  Developed by Tim Berners-Lee and others, it overlays a broader vision for how data can be organized and interconnected.  Its  motivation is to create a "web of data", beyond just the "web of documents".  

Using IRIs as a kind of universal "token", the Semantic Web pattern expresses information using machine-readable formats and *formal* language approaches like tuples, RDF (Resource Description Framework) serialization, and ontologies. This data augmentation discipline helps support automated discovery and reasoning, data integration and interoperability across disparate sources, and interesting new applications--including, but not limited to, search.

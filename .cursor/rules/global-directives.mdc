# Global Cursor AI Directives

## Persistent Directives

### "Going Forward" Directive
When the user prefixes a directive with "going forward", it remains in effect until notified otherwise. This directive applies to itself.

**Definition**: A persistent directive modifier that makes any instruction or definition persist across:
- The current session
- All future sessions
- All future conversations with me

When you include "going forward" in a directive, I should:
1. **Save the instruction** to my persistent memory/rules
2. **Apply it immediately** in the current session
3. **Maintain it** across all future sessions
4. **Treat it as a permanent rule** until explicitly modified

### Git Consolidate Directive
When the user requests "git consolidate", immediately:

1. **Review Phase**: Run `git status && git diff` to show all changes in a single command
2. **Analysis**: If unexpected files appear in the changes, report them to the user and stop. If all changes are expected, proceed automatically to Step 3
3. **Execution Phase**: Offer the command `git add . && git commit -m "[descriptive message]" && git push` for user execution

**Usage**: `git consolidate [optional commit message]`

**Safety Features**:
- **Single review command**: `git status && git diff` shows everything at once
- **Silent on expected changes**: Only reports unexpected modifications
- **Automatic progression**: Proceeds to execution phase if no issues detected
- **User control**: User decides whether to execute the final command

**Key Behaviors**:
- No commentary on expected changes
- No "what to do next" questions
- Automatic progression when changes are expected
- User executes final command when ready

## Global AI Interaction Patterns
- Use structured responses
- Include context in prompts
- Be explicit about requirements
- Provide examples when needed
- Document AI-related decisions
- Follow established directive patterns

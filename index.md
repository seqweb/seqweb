## ***SeqWeb*** _is to the_ **OEIS** _as_ **DBpedia** _is to_ **Wikipedia**.

- SeqWeb extends the OEIS—one of the world's largest mathematical knowledge bases—with an independent, open, knowledge graph resource.

- SeqWeb's mission is to further empower and amplify the discovery and development of this knowledge.

- SeqWeb empowers a federation of community-driven deployments: `seqweb.org` is the public instance, but anyone can develop and run their own.

- SeqWeb is in active development with core infrastructure, architecture and ontology design and implementation underway.

- SeqWeb welcomes interested potential early collaborators, academic partners, and supporters.
